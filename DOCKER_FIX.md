# Docker Build Error Fix

## Problem
The Docker build was failing with:
```
=> ERROR [app production 6/9] COPY --from=builder /app/client/dist ./client/dist
```

## Root Cause
The Dockerfile was trying to copy `/app/client/dist` but the actual build output goes to `/app/dist/public` based on the Vite configuration.

## Solution Applied
1. **Fixed Dockerfile**: Removed the incorrect `COPY --from=builder /app/client/dist ./client/dist` line
2. **Correct build structure**: The build process creates:
   - Backend: `dist/index.js`
   - Frontend: `dist/public/` (contains index.html and assets)
3. **Added verification**: Build verification step to ensure structure is correct

## Updated Dockerfile
The production stage now correctly copies only:
```dockerfile
COPY --from=builder /app/dist ./dist
```

## Verification
The application serves static files from `dist/public` in production mode as configured in `server/vite.ts`.

## Usage
Your Docker build should now work correctly. The container will:
1. Build both frontend and backend during the builder stage
2. Copy the complete `dist` directory to production stage
3. Serve the application on port 5000
4. Include health check endpoint at `/api/health`

## Memory Storage
The application continues to use memory storage (no database required) as configured.
