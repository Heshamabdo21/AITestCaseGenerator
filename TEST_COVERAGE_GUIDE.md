# Comprehensive Test Coverage Guide

## Overview
The Test Case Generator now supports all major types of test coverage to ensure thorough validation of your applications.

## Test Coverage Types

### Core Functional Testing
- **Positive Test Cases**: Valid scenarios with expected inputs and successful outcomes
- **Negative Test Cases**: Invalid inputs, error conditions, and exception handling
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, limits, and corner cases

### Security & Performance Testing
- **Security Test Cases**: Authentication, authorization, data protection, input validation
- **Performance Test Cases**: Load testing, response times, scalability, resource usage

### User Experience Testing  
- **UI Test Cases**: User interface elements, layout, visual validation
- **Usability Test Cases**: User experience flows, accessibility, ease of use

### Technical & Integration Testing
- **API Test Cases**: Endpoint testing, request/response validation, data integrity
- **Compatibility Test Cases**: Cross-browser, cross-device, cross-platform testing

## Configuration Options

### Test Target Platforms
- **Web Portal Tests**: Browser-based application testing
- **Mobile App Tests**: Native and responsive mobile application testing  
- **API Tests**: Backend service and integration testing

### Test Complexity Levels
- **Simple**: Basic scenarios with minimal steps
- **Medium**: Standard workflows with moderate complexity
- **Complex**: Advanced scenarios with multiple integrations

## How It Works

1. **Configuration**: Select test types and platforms in the AI Configuration section
2. **Generation**: The system creates comprehensive test cases based on user stories
3. **Coverage**: Each test type includes specific steps, prerequisites, and expected results
4. **Validation**: Test cases include detailed validation criteria and success metrics

## Benefits

- **Complete Coverage**: Ensures no critical testing gaps
- **Standardized Format**: Consistent test case structure across all types
- **Platform-Specific**: Tailored test steps for web, mobile, and API scenarios
- **Automated Generation**: Reduces manual test creation time
- **Quality Assurance**: Built-in best practices for each test type

## Next Steps

1. Review the AI Configuration settings to enable desired test types
2. Import or create user stories with detailed acceptance criteria
3. Generate comprehensive test cases using the enhanced coverage options
4. Execute tests across all configured platforms and scenarios
